          h5 Commitment ~ Inspiration ~ Dedication ~ Values

          p Dance Unlimited is committed to encouraging all dancers to strive for excellence and enjoy the journey along the way.  We believe each dancer has the ability to increase her/his physical, emotional, and intellectual well-being through our dance program.  Our goal is to provide quality dance instruction through caring, professional instructors in a friendly, family-oriented atmosphere.  Dance Unlimited promotes strong self-confidence, self-respect, discipline, and appreciation through the fine arts of dance.  We inspire every dancer to find the creativity inside herself/himself as "we dance to tell a story" each year.

          p Dance Unlimited is dedicated to our studio families to ensure you are kept well-informed of the progress of each dancer.  We believe open communication and encouragement both at home and within the dance studio will promote a stronger self-worth within each child.  We are strong believers that "Children Learn What They Live" and strive towards promoting the same commitment to our studio families as we do to our dancers.  The success of each dancer is a result of great teamwork between the dance studio and our dance studio families.

          p Dance Unlimited values the Middletown-Odessa-Townsend community and we support many fundraising efforts sponsored throughout our locality.  It is through community service that we can teach (and learn) the value of human kindness.  “Together, We Can Make A Difference” is our studio's fundraising motto.  This is the generation of dancers that can step up and make a change in human kindness and create positive attitudes for our future.   These are the values Dance Unlimited strives to promote with each of our dancers. 
           | It's more than just dance...

          h5 If you build it…They will dance!

          p Dance Unlimited’s short-term vision is to expand our fine arts programs based on our community’s continue interest in dance, theater, and physical fitness.  Our vision is determined through the eyes of our dancers.  WE plan to take our program as far as our dancers can dream.

          p Dance Unlimited’s long-term vision is to inspire our community with non-competitive dance education and offer many performance opportunities in a facility that will motivate, educate, and develop an appreciation of the fine arts.  WE will build a facility where dancing dreams are shared throughout our community.  It is through our mission and vision that Dance Unlimited will create "change" in our world's future through our dancers.  WE will strive for excellence and accept only positive thinking.
